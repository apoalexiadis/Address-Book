# Address Book

#For the current assignment, you will need to implement a console application using C# for managing contacts, an "Address Book."

#Specifically, your application will support the following functionalities as menu options:

#1.View all available contacts                                                 
#2.Add a new contact                                                            
#3.Search for a contact by name                                                               
#4.Search for a contact by phone number                                                              
#5.Edit a contact by name                                                                   
#6.Delete a contact by name                                                            
#7.Exit the application                                                                                  

#For each contact, the fields to be stored should include:                                                                                 

#Name                                                                                                                        
#Phone number                                                                                                                             
#Email                                                                                                                                                          
#Address
